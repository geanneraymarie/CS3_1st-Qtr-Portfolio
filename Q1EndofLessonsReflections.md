# 5 topics that I know very well
1. **Javascript Variable Declaration** - I had already practiced variable declaration in C++. Many exercises in grade 8 used this. Thanks to that practice, I was able to get the hang of variable declaration in Javascript with less difficulty.
2. **Javascript Input and Output Functions** - It's very similar to the way we'd do it in C++. Like I said, we did many exercises that used this. Since we were able to practice this already in C++, it was easier for me to understand how to do it in Javascript.
3. **HTML Customization** - I really like designing. I tend to learn something more if I'm interested in it. Since I enjoy designing, I had fun learning how to customize things in HTML.
4. **Using CSS to Design HTML** - Like I said, I like designing. I enjoyed what I was doing already with only HTML. Since I was already interested, learning about CSS was not hard.
5. **Markdown** - This is one of the most basic topics for me. It's very straightforward, and easy to remember. The way it works is similar to how you can format text in Discord too.

# 5 topics that I need further practice on
1. **Loop Control Structures** - I am familiar with the concept of loops. I have practiced it in grade 8 with C++. However, I tend to get confused on how to apply it.
2. **Declaring Functions** - It's similar to how you would declare a variable. It's simply that I would say variable declaration is easier. I still need practice for this.
3. **Javascript Operations** - The way it's done in Javascript is similar to how you would do it in C++. However, it can get a bit confusing at times. I need to practice using these.
4. **JavaScript Number Objects** - For me, it's somewhat similar to variable declaration. It's a bit more difficult, though. I'm not entirely familiar with the constants yet.
5. **Printing a Function Output** - It's almost the same as normal output. It's simple. However, I need more practice using Javascript in general, which includes
